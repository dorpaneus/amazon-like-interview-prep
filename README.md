# 🚀 14-Day Curriculum — AWS Systems Engineer Interview Prep

> [!NOTE]
> **Target Roles:** Systems Engineer / DevOps Engineer (Managed Operations) / Systems Dev Engineer II
> **Daily Commitment:** ~3 hours every day, including weekends
> **Progress:** Days 1–11 written · Days 12–14 pending

This repository contains everything required to pass a heavy infrastructure and behavioral interview loop. It is designed to be completely self-contained—no endless Googling required.

## ⏱️ Daily Structure (~3 hours)

| Block | Duration | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🌅 Morning** | ~1h | **Concepts + Reading.** New material lands here while you're fresh. |
| **💻 Midday** | ~1.5h | **Hands-on Labs.** Run commands, break things, observe. |
| **🎯 Afternoon** | ~0.5h | **Drills + Behavioral.** Past-question repetition, one LP/STAR story per day. |

> [!TIP]
> **Standard Topic Flow:** 
> Context → Mental model → Tool walkthrough → Hands-on exercises → Self-check questions (with folded answers).

## 📚 Story Bank Target — Leadership Principles

By Day 13 you should have **~12–15 stories** tagged to LPs, with at least one strong story per LP. 

> [!WARNING]
> **The most heavily-weighted LPs for SysEng/DevOps Managed Operations:**
> Focus your strongest, most detailed technical stories here.
> 
> *   **Ownership** (on-call, "your service is your problem")
> *   **Dive Deep** (root cause analysis, complex debugging)
> *   **Insist on the Highest Standards** (operational excellence, automation)
> *   **Bias for Action** (incident response, moving fast safely)
> *   **Earn Trust** (blameless postmortems, cross-team work)
> *   **Customer Obsession** (uptime and reliability as a customer-facing metric)

## ✅ Pre-loop Checklist (Day 14 Review)

- [ ] Story bank covering all 16 LPs, each rehearsed out loud in STAR format.
- [ ] At least one **incident story** walked through end-to-end (timeline, mitigation, root cause, action items).
- [ ] One **mentoring / cross-team leadership** story.
- [ ] One **"disagreed with a decision"** story.
- [ ] One **"data contradicted intuition"** story.
- [ ] Refreshed AWS basics (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC) — interviewers will frame Linux questions inside AWS scenarios.
- [ ] 2–3 thoughtful questions prepared for *each* interviewer (specific to their scope, not generic).
- [ ] "What happens when I load a website?" walked end-to-end without notes.
- [ ] Brendan Gregg's **USE method** opener memorized.
- [ ] `rd.break` root recovery procedure memorized.
- [ ] LVM recovery procedure (`vgcfgrestore`) memorized.
- [ ] BPF/tcpdump filter syntax for common cases (`tcp[tcpflags]`, `not port 22`, etc.).
- [ ] Live-coding log-parsing solution rehearsed end-to-end (Python or Bash).
